# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

## Introduction
For our project we compared how different models with varying levels of complexity perform when doing sentiment analysis. We tested the models with different word embeddings to see how these would impact the results as well.

## Models
We tested the following models:
* Logistic Regression
* FFNN
* LSTM

## Running the Code

First run the data_intake.ipynb notebook to get the data in the correct format and generated for the other models. This will also create the word embeddings from our dataset and save them

Then each other notebook containing the models can be run independently.

### Logistic Regression
For the logistic regression model, first unzip word2vec200txt.zip.
Then run the logistic_regression.ipynb notebook.

### FFNN
For the FFNN model, run the FFNN.ipynb notebook.

### LSTM
For the LSTM model, run the lstm_train.ipynb notebook.
